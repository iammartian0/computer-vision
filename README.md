This is edited [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data) from the course [Practical deeplearning for coders](https://course.fast.ai/).

The main goal of this notebook is to take advantage of capabilities of existing pretrained models. To conclude in a single word - 'Transfer Learning'

The model used is pretrained 'Resnet18', finetuned on images of target classes.
The images are scrapped from internet.

The model took around 3 minutes to train on kaggle 'CPU'.
